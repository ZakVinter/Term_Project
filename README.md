## Code


### 1_All_England_Code.R


This is the first R script that should be ran to replicate this project. This script firstly web scrapes all penalties for the whole English football league for all years between 2013-2021 and all teams. This data is then save first as individual yearly data sets. Secondly, an appended data set is made with all observations for all years. Next, an Annual data set is made which takes the average penalties received by each team in each year. This is then made into a tidy version with Country name added to distinguish it from Scotland when merging occurs. Next, the data set was split into pre and post treatment. This is used to form lines of best fit in visualizations.


### 2_All_Scotland_Code.R


This code does the same as what has been described above, however no pre and post data set are due to no treatment in this country.
